# EcoMap
Ecomap is a project made by me - Catja Månsson - designed to easily illustrate data connected to ecology and hydrology.

## **Background**
The idea of Ecomap started during an academic project, when I tried to illustrate how hydrology and ecology data affected a given area. I noticed that most existing 
tools and databases were often complex and difficult to use, especially for beginners. To make this kind of data more accessible, I developed Ecomap as a way to 
structure and visualize hydrology, ecology, and field observations in a clear and understandable format.

The project focuses on three separate layers that can be analyzed independently while contributing to an overall understanding of the environment.

## Project components
### Hydrology
- Focuses on water levels, flow patterns, and potential flooding areas if water levels rise.
- Data comes from GIS sources and field measurements.
- This layer is visualized independently from ecological and field data.
### Ecology
- Describes vegetation types, habitats, and threatened species in the area.
- Data comes from national databases and literature (e.g., SLU vegetation classifications, Swedish Red List, Artfakta).
- Provides a visual and ecological context for understanding the area, independent of water measurements.
### Field Study
- Documents on-site observations, including soil samples, pH measurements, and flora/fauna surveys.
- Serves to validate and complement the data from Hydrology and Ecology.
- Example measurements include soil pH, moisture levels, and species observations.
### Custom
- This layer allows users to combine Hydrology, Ecology, and Field Study data into a single map.
- Enables custom analysis and visualization of multiple layers together.
